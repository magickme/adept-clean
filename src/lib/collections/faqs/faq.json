  },
  {
    "question": "How long do I have access to the course?",
    "answer": "How does lifetime access sound? After enrolling, you have unlimited access to this course for as long as you like—across any and all devices you own."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a refund policy on the courses?",
    "answer": "Here's my pledge to you: If you watch up to three units of either course, and still truly feel that by sincerely applying the techniques in this course, you won't make back at *least* 10x the amount you invested in the course, I will refund 100% of your money. I'm happy to make this pledge, because the feedback I get instead is people repeatedly telling me that I am charging far too little for the course!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Do existing Magick.Me subscribers get access to this course?",
    "answer": "No. Existing Magick.Me subscribers will need to register for this course separately. The Adept Initiative is a completely separate Mega-Course with massive new production and stringent student guidelines, and is separate from the main Magick.Me courses. The regular Magick.Me courses will continue as planned at their own pricing tier."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need prior experience?",
    "answer": "No. These courses will be massively groundbreaking for everyone from absolute beginners to students with decades of experience. You do not need to have taken any of the other Magick.Me courses before enrolling."
  },
  {
    "question": "I have extremely limited time in my schedule. Can I still take this course?",
    "answer": "Yes! This course is designed so that it can be taken on even the busiest schedule and integrated into your work day during moments of downtime. With a few moments here and there to watch units (or listen to them in your headphones like a podcast while doing errands or during transportation), you'll be just fine. You should also provision about 30 minutes a day for meditations and exercises, either first thing in the morning or at another convenient time. If you have more time, you can of course extend the exercises much longer, but 30 minutes a day is solid."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to buy any extra equipment to take this course?",
    "answer": "No. You should be able to do the exercises in this course empty-handed, or by repurposing common items. You certainly CAN purchase fancier gear—but you don't NEED to."
  },
  {
    "question": "I've already taken the version of Adept Initiative I from 2020. Do I get access to the new version?",
    "answer": "The 2025 version of Adept Initiative I is a completely new experience, and must be purchased separately. If you've already taken the 2020 version of Adept I, this new version will be incredibly valuable to you, both to brush up on the work you've already done and to deepen your practice with all-new, refined material." 
  },
{
    "question": "Can I take Adept Initiative II without Adept Initiative I?",
    "answer": "We don't recommend it. Adept Initiative II is a follow-up to Adept Initiative I, and builds on the material covered in Adept I. If you haven't taken Adept I, you'll miss out on some of the deeper connections and understandings that make Adept II so transformative. If you've already taken the 2020 version of Adept I, you'll be able to follow along just fine, but we recommend taking both new courses as a series for maximum benefit." 
  },
  {
    "question": "Will I be charged taxes?",
    "answer": "Taxes may be charged depending on your location and local tax laws. Any applicable taxes will be clearly shown before you complete your purchase."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is my data kept safe?",
    "answer": "We take data privacy seriously. Your personal information and course progress are encrypted and stored securely. We never share your data with third parties without your explicit consent."

    "question": "What forms of payment do you take?",
    "answer": "We accept all major credit cards, as well as PayPal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are payments fully secured?",
    "answer": "Yes, all payments are processed through secure, encrypted channels. We use industry-standard security measures to protect your financial information."
