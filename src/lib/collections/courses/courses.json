We will also do immense work on resolving internal conflicts‚Äîthe competing desires that produce self-sabotage‚Äîso that the road forward opens and remains open.

I have been able to recognize when I do not pay attention, or disassociate. My conversations are better. I work more effectively. I do not overwhelm and shut down like I used to. My habits are far more positive. The mental states I am reaching are sublime in my most mundane moments of the day. I feel people are opening up more, because I am far less guarded, and open up more myself. I have dealt with some of the most debilitating anxiety and claustrophobia for a while, but most certainly these past three years. These tools you have provided have been the only effective thing to not only stop these episodes, but prevent them entirely. Make no mistake, you are saving lives with this school. Negativity in my life has become malleable, instead of a death sentence. I love what I have learned, and only regret that the course is over. You will be seeing my name in future courses guaranteed.

I have been in the training and education profession for over a decade. The compendium of knowledge and supplementary material that Jason has assembled is only rivaled by the highest echelon of academic providers. The integration of technology; I.e. biofeedback tools, web based analytics, and Ubiquitous/Blended Learning techniques to extend the classroom beyond the traditional setting are all hallmarks of an instructor that understands how to truly integrate the course material into a highly impactful class which benefits from the best technological tools available. Beyond that, the amount of contact hours, time on required tasks, and availability for student question and answer sessions should not be taken for granted. In summary, this course is a steal for the price and I will whole heartedly sign up for the follow on. Love and good Magick all.",
