Can you guess what happened next? I started the course, and by day two it had already changed my life. So don't hesitate to sign up for Jason's courses. He keeps his promises.",

He really did take all of the knowledge he gained over the years and pulled all the best practices together to help me discover my True Will and get all the negativity and distractions out of my life. I went into this unsure of what I should expect and came out the other side with so many clear cut goals and the mental clarity to get there. Thank you again and I can't wait for future courses.",

I recommend the school to you if you are ready to give everything and want to discover what it is you want and how to get it. Jason packs the classes with valuable information and you can wring the juice out of them and into your own life. He really knows magick without being ungrounded or cryptic, and he makes himself available to his students completely and answers questions thoroughly. This class is especially useful to artists, musicians and anyone who has to blaze their own trail. Or anyone that wants to get to the core of their reality.",

At the start of this course, I was stuck in an apartment I didn't want to be in and work that wasn't fulfilling. At the end of six weeks I was able to move out and find a new beautiful apartment, and expanded my business to something that now fills my heart. Thank you for all your hard work and effort. It is treasured.",

I know silence in all things. Take this course. Listen to the lectures. Do ALL the daily and weekly exercises. Buy a meditation bench! Commit 100%, and It will change you on a fundamental level.",

Buying the Adept Initiative was like paying for a cheap plane ticket only to find yourself on a first class rocketship ride that changes you as a person. The content is easily understood and a joy to watch. It is magick grounded in history, made practical. The course as a whole is the closest thing I've had to a reality warping experience without drugs. If you have an interest in any of the material in the Adept Initiative, it will deliver beyond your expectations and more. Cannot recommend it enough.",

The value that Jason Louv has provided in this course is beyond anything I have seen in the magical community, and in academia thus far. I have been in the training and education profession for over a decade. The compendium of knowledge and supplementary material that Jason has assembled is only rivaled by the highest echelon of academic providers. The integration of technology; I.e. biofeedback tools, web based analytics, and Ubiquitous/Blended Learning techniques to extend the classroom beyond the traditional setting are all hallmarks of an instructor that understands how to truly integrate the course material into a highly impactful class which benefits from the best technological tools available. Beyond that, the amount of contact hours, time on required tasks, and availability for student question and answer sessions should not be taken for granted. In summary, this course is a steal for the price and I will whole heartedly sign up for the follow on. Love and good Magick all.",

As someone who has been tip toeing around Magick for a while, but strongly drawn by it, I was lead step by step to establish a practice of meditation, dream work, keeping a Magickal Record, challenging me to expand my self and consciousness. Jason also displayed a intense sense of responsibility to us regarding the role Magick can play in our lives. He also expressed the caution that Magick or any path is for you. We are not to try to be saviors of the world, our country, or our friends and love ones. One particular bit of advise I received helped me near the end of the course. In the morning I was turning off my computer and the screen went dark. I was just looking at the screen and I saw something move left to right behind me. I didn't think too much about it until going to bed. I started obsessing about this image in the darkened screen and wondering if it was a spirit, or some malevolent being. After some time, I remembered that Jason mentioned that if we start flipping out, ground yourself. I had not been getting the normal amount of sleep and decided not to get up early, but get more sleep. Thank you Jason for all the apparent time, expertise, experience and caring that you displayed during the Adept Initiative Class. I have truly been a pleasure and privilege participating in it.",

My habits are far more positive. The mental states I am reaching are sublime in my most mundane moments of the day. I feel people are opening up more, because I am far less guarded, and open up more myself. I have dealt with some of the most debilitating anxiety and claustrophobia for a while, but most certainly these past three years. These tools you have provided have been the only effective thing to not only stop these episodes, but prevent them entirely. Make no mistake, you are saving lives with this school. Negativity in my life has become malleable, instead of a death sentence. I love what I have learned, and only regret that the course is over. You will be seeing my name in future courses guaranteed.
