I would say that it is the 'introduction to life' course parents should teach their children to become well developed adults. That said most of us didn't receive that training and it is an excellent course for everyone on their personal journey to begin with. It is a solid foundational course for any style of magick one wishes to pursue.",

As a form of media it's clean, VERY well recorded, easy to navigate, and seemingly foolproof. The overwhelmingly abundant information, exercises, everything, it was all, to the greatest degree, thoroughly the most useful, insightful, helpful, and meaningful learning experience I think I've ever partaken in. This stuff doesn't spoil if you leave it out over night, you can take it with you anywhere you go and the lessons can be applied to anything life has to throw at you. The Alchemy of Chaos has acted as both an anchor and compass in this coronavirus shitstorm and I don't know where I'd be or what I'd be doing without it. Jason is the best teacher I've never met and I can always tell with confidence that he is the real deal, is a no-bullshit person, and knows what he's talking about, and with the best intentions for all sentient life. I'm eagerly awaiting more courses and can't wait to see what comes next from Magick.Me. Thank you :)",

I had not made the connections between the topics and each chakra before. As we went through the material little dings of 'ah-ha' moments would happen and I realized how I needed to change what I was doing in order to improve that aspect of my life. The overall greater life transformation is still happening but I have set myself up for success by implementing various protocols learned here. I appreciated how everything was laid out plainly in an order that made sense.",

I myself have made changes in my life externally and internally that I see affecting the trajectory of my whole incarnation.

It is a major improvement on the Adept Initiative course in terms of clarity and delivery of content. It is comprehensive enough to cover all you need while also allowing room for you to discover your own operational practices outside of it and it just builds your momentum and confidence in all the right ways. It has worked on me cooperatively with my own conscious and unconscious process of self-rediscovery and meaning making and I highly recommend it to anybody interested. You are interested for a reason.. maybe a reason deeper than your awareness.. these things always pay back the attention given to them.",

        "quote": "The Alchemy of Chaos was the perfect follow up to the Adept Initiative I have previously completed. However this course holds it own with out a doubt. Working through the Chakra system the way Jason Louv has laid out here, has been one of the best decisions I have made in recent memory. Through this in depth break down of each of the Chakras, and their relationship to my Body, Mind, Emotions, Habits, Strengths, Weaknesses, etc I have found and established an intimate and powerful connection to my self, my being, my body, and what I believe to be my purpose in this life. I have lost weight. I have quit drinking alcohol entirely. I am exercising daily. I am drinking more clean water than I ever have. My household now breaths cleaner air and consumes clean water!  My Homelife has become happier, healthier, and richer than ever before. This course is not just a results based pursuit, or a feel good shot in the arm. These practices and teachings have effected my life with lasting positive change. And for goodness sake, the lessons and information are presented in concise,  understandable, approachable, practical and relatable units!!! The links provided to the tools and products recommend are another added bonus. Lastly, I will mention that through this course, I have come to discover and to know what my aim in this life is and will continue too be, which is something I will treasure and cherish daily. This course has not only shed light on what often seems to be a very misunderstood and chaotic path, but has also shown me ways to craft my existence into something beautiful, and worthy of pursuit. Thank you Mr. Louv, from the bottom of my heart.",

        "quote": "I very much enjoyed the alchemy of chaos. I found it more practical and pragmatic than the adept initiative, given the context of the material covered. I felt that the adept initiative covered more of the esoteric, which I enjoy far more overall but alchemy most certainly delivers on what it promises. I wish there could be somewhat of an update to the material, as a lot of it pertains to the uncertainties of the pandemic around 2020, which isn't without merit but feels somewhat dated three years out. That being said I've been very happy with both courses, and always leave craving more, but satisfied with where things end off. I'm very excited for what this school has in store for the future, and will be paying attention to whatever may come from it, and for sure return as a customer in time. Thank you Mr. Louv.",
