MAS TER T HE P O W ER O F
INFLUENCE TO DAY!
Dear Friend,
Welcome to Mastering Influence: A 10-Day System for Strengthening
Your Emotional Impact and Increasing Your Sales, and congratulations
on your decision to step up and take your life to the next level. First,
I want to express how much I respect you for your commitment
to improving yourself. There are plenty of people who talk about
improving themselves, but few people actually do and I commend
you for taking action.
Over the course of my career, I've had the privilege of working
with millions of people from over 100 countries. And what I’ve
learned—whether it was meeting with a high-powered Fortune 500
CEO, superstar, or working mom—is one fundamental truth: Our
ability to influence is the greatest power we can have.
Influence affects everything about us. It really comes down to
our emotional connection with ourselves and others and thereby
affects our career, our finances, how we raise our children, and even
how we treat our bodies. Those who master the art of influence have
the ability to move people emotionally and tremendously impact
what they do. The person who influences is also a person who
contributes beyond him/herself and becomes a true leader.
This 10-day system is designed to help you become a master
influencer in all areas of your life. Mastering Influence is about
learning timeless strategies for increasing your sales. At its core,
however, this program is designed to help you increase the quality of
your life, discover new distinctions, and implement innovative ways
to create more possibilities.
To guide you through this program, I have the distinct privilege
of introducing you to Joseph McClendon III, a renowned coaching
and sales expert. Joseph has conducted training for countless Fortune
500 companies around the world. He has taught human reengineering, leadership, advanced communication, and human

influence course-work at the University of California. He’s also one
of my dearest friends, and I’m grateful that he’s sharing his expertise
with you.
So let’s begin! It’s certainly up to you to decide how you want to
approach this program, but if you are truly looking to maximize your
results, I recommend these three tips:
. Play full out! When asked a question, respond out loud along
with the studio audience and respond honestly.
. Use the workbook to review key concepts, and complete
your assignments right away! Also, record any additional
thoughts or feelings about what you’ve learned and how you
might use it.
. Carry your Power Tools flashcards with you. Use them
right before sales calls, meetings with your boss, and
important interactions (with your children, for example).
Remember, every situation you encounter is affected by
your ability to influence.
I hope you enjoy this program and thank you for allowing me
to share it with you as you create new possibilities for yourself and
those around you. Remember that everything you already have
accomplished—and everything you strive to achieve—comes from
your ability to master this power of extraordinary influence.

Live with Passion!

C OMMITM ENT: YO UR G REAT E S T P O W E R
Whether you’re a salesperson, a parent, or simply a person trying to
relate to other people, influence is one of the most important skills
you can master. You need to be able to influence your government,
your community, other people, and, most important, yourself. Your
ability to influence affects how effective you are at raising your
kids, advancing in your job, maintaining your health, growing your
finances, and fostering relationships that matter most to you.
The power to influence is the single most important skill you can
master. It can literally give you the power to shape your destiny and
alter the quality of life for yourself or anybody you really care about.
Think about the people who have shaped our society. How did
people like John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Susan B.
Anthony make such a difference in the world? They had the ability
to influence people’s thinking.
If you come from a place of deep caring to develop a strong
relationship with people—if you look for their deepest needs, not
just what they say they want, but what their gut level wants and
needs—and you help them to meet that, there will be no limit to the
income, the joy, and the deep friendships you have.

Five Steps to Mastery
These simple steps can help you master any area of your life:
. Initial impact: To create a change in your life—to make things
the way you want them—you must make an initial impact.
. Repetition: Repetition is the mother of skill. If you do
something over and over again, you become a master.
. Utilization: Apply what you learn. Don’t just repeat it in your
head; repeat it in your daily life.
. Integration: When you begin integrating these concepts into
your daily routines, they become effortless.
. Reinforcement: If you don’t use it, you’ll lose it. The only way to
stay strong is to continually use your new skill.

The Learning Process
How do you go from being brand-new at something to becoming
a master? Abraham Maslow, a founder of humanistic psychology,
described four steps to learning:
. Unconscious incompetence: You don’t know what you don’t know.
. Conscious incompetence: You know that you don’t know
something.
. Conscious competence: You learn to do something, but it takes
your full concentration.
. Unconscious competence: You’re a master! You can do
something without having to think about it anymore.

day 2:

THE SCIENCE OF PERSUASION: WHY WE BUY
People will not buy your product or service (or do their homework,
or take out the trash) unless they feel pressure to do so. There are
two kinds of pressure:
External pressure created from the outside (such as through
television or a salesperson’s demands)
Internal pressure created from the inside in the form of an
innate desire for your product or service
Of the two, internal pressure is much more powerful since people buy
for their own reasons.

tHe tWIn FoRCeS oF motIVAtIon:
PAIn AnD PleASURe
…………………
two forces drive all human behavior: the desire to
avoid pain and the desire to gain pleasure. People will
do far more to avoid pain than to get pleasure.
If people do not buy, it’s because they associate more
pain to buying than not buying. If people do buy, it’s
because they associate more pleasure to buying than
not buying.
As a persuader or a salesperson, you must sell
consequences—positive consequences if they buy, and
negative consequences if they don’t.

DAY TWO

Questions in the prospect’s mind
“Can I trust you? Do you really have my best interests in mind or
are you just here to make a sale?”
“What is this, what’s in it for me, and can you prove it?”
“Will it really give me what I want and need?”
“Do I really need it now?”

The Process of Selling
Selling is like the Dickens pattern (from Charles Dickens’ famous
story, A Christmas Carol): It’s the process of finding people’s pain,
disturbing them, stirring up their pain, making them feel the hurt,
and then healing it through new sets of choices, usually in the form
of your products or services.
 .

Find a deep want or interest. Remember, people don’t
buy needs; they buy wants.

 .

Disturb them. Stirring up the hurt is not negative.
It’s your job to be a healer of the hurt.

 .

Show them how to heal their discomfort by using
your product. Persuasion is the process of getting your
customers to clearly associate their most desired feelings
or states to your product or service.

much logic (LRBN)? What were your dominant reasons to avoid
buying (DRAB)?

. List three items you really wanted but did not buy. Why didn’t
you buy? What combination of ERBN, LRBN, and DRAB did
you have?

. Choose one of the items you did not buy and pretend you’re the
salesperson. What combination of ERBN and LRBN would have
been the right combination to compel you to buy?

Remember:
People buy for emotional reasons and justify with logic.

DAY TWO

The Primary Tools of Influence
There are four primary tools through which you can influence
someone’s beliefs or change their approach to buying.
. Rapport: To create a long-term impact, you must show people
that you care about them, that you have their interests in mind,
and that you are like them.
When you have rapport, you align with people and can lead
them in the direction you want to go.
10 ways to create rapport:
Bring up a mutual interest
Give a gift (induces reciprocation)
Give a referral
Insult someone (Yes, sometimes you can
get rapport by insulting someone.)
Tell a story
Give a sample of something
Pay a compliment
Make a startling statement
Give good service
Listen

DAY TWO



. Questions: Asking questions is your most powerful tool for
influencing people. When you understand what people believe
and how they make decisions, all you have to do is show them
that buying your product or service is consistent with those
beliefs. That’s all selling is!
Questions help you:
Find out what’s really going on in people’s heads
Find out their real motivations
Find out their beliefs
Test close
Take pressure off
Show you really care
Build rapport
Induce reciprocation
Put people in state
Bring out and overcome objections



DAY TWO

. Personal congruency: Congruency means that your verbal
and nonverbal communication match. Congruency comes
from feeling absolutely certain about what you’re saying. The
person who feels the most certain will be the person who
influences most.
In terms of sales, congruency means being certain that what
you’re offering is worth more than what you’re asking in return.
Remember, buying is just the transference of emotion; your
congruency will help people feel certain that if they make this
decision, they’ll get more pleasure and less pain.
Congruency must be maintained daily; otherwise, you fall victim
to the law of familiarity.

tHe lAW oF FAmIlIARItY
…………………
If you’re around anything long enough,
you take it for granted.

. State management: It’s absolutely critical to manage your
emotional states. If someone cancels an appointment and you
let that put you into a state of frustration, you’ll diminish your
ability to influence.
When you practice state management, you’ll learn how to
discipline disappointment and take negative states like rejection
and turn them around so they empower you.

empowering belief or statement you say over and over again with
emotional intensity), and then practice delivering it congruently
over and over again.

you’re selling or persuading. How would your physiology look?

THE DIFFERENCE B ETW EEN
S UC C ESS & FAI LURE
What makes the difference between success and failure? Beliefs.
What you believe determines what you will do.
How many cold calls would you make, how hard would you
prospect, how many hours would you work in a day if you really
believed that doing those things would bring you everything you
wanted in terms of happiness, joy, and money?
A lot of people set goals, but goals aren’t enough. You must believe
that your goals can really happen.

or not, you are riGht.”

Two Kinds of Beliefs
. Global beliefs
I am ________. People are ________. Life is ________.
Global beliefs affect the way you interpret what things mean.
In selling, discover the prospect’s beliefs and align with them.
Don’t attack them.
. Rules
If I ________ , then it will mean ________.
Rules are cause-and-effect belief systems that help guide
your decisions.
DAY THREE



exercise
Selling is transference of emotion. You can’t give something you
don’t already have. To overcome objections, make a sale, or persuade
someone, you need to have answers to the customers’ questions
before they even ask. Believe your answers at such a deep level that
no matter what objection comes up, you’ll be ready to handle it.

RememBeR tHe toP FIVe QUeStIonS
CUStomeRS ASk tHemSelVeS:

1. “Does the salesperson have my best interests in mind?”
2. “What will this product mean to me?”
3. “Is it worth it to me?” or “What will I have to give up?”
4. “What will other people think or say?”
5. “Do I really need it now?”

This exercise will get you ready to answer those questions with
integrity and conviction.
. Why do you care about the prospect? Why can people count on
the fact that you’re not going to take advantage of them? What
beliefs do you have about that?

. What are the advantages and benefits of your product? What will
it mean to people? What are some of the major benefits for you?

DAY THREE

. Why is your product worth 10 times what you ask for, in terms
of money, time, or effort?

around them? How will it benefit the people around them?

. Why should they buy it now?

Three Reasons People Fail
. They don’t have compelling enough reasons to succeed when
the going gets tough.
. They have limiting belief systems, such as “It won’t work,”
“I tried it before,” and “I’ve tried everything and nothing works.”
. They don’t consistently manage their state. The ability to
manage your state is the difference between success and failure.
“failure is not the only Punishment for laziness;
there is also the suCCess of others.”

— JULeS ReNARD —

DAY THREE



Why Should You Manage Your State?
The state you’re in determines your behavior and your
performance. All performance is state related. You’re not selling a
product; you’re selling a state. The state you’re in gets linked to
your product. If you’re in a great state, prospects think, “If that’s
the product, I certainly want it!”

Three Ways to change Your State
. Change the way you’re using your physiology.
Change your breathing.
Change the way you move.
Change what you eat, when you eat.
Develop your own personal power moves—movements that
instantly put you in a peak state so you can get the most out
of yourself.
. Control your focus.
What you feel is based on what you focus on. Control what
and how you think.
Use questions to control your focus. What are some
empowering questions you could ask yourself? What are some
questions that could put you in a great state right before a
sales interview?
. Develop a results ritual: Q.S.P.
Ask yourself quality Questions.
Do a series of Swish patterns to condition your mind to move
toward your goals.
Do some Power moves to manage your state.



DAY THREE

SWISH PATTERN
…………………
think of a negative image that keeps you from succeeding
at the highest level. Create a positive image of yourself the
way you’d be if you were already living your goals. Bring
the positive image up behind the negative one, making it
bigger and bigger, until it explodes through the negative
one, smashes it in a million pieces, and takes its place. As
that’s happening, say whoosh! Do it quickly. Repeat until
the negative feeling is hard to retrieve,
or repeat at least a dozen times in a row.

Your Assignment
. Tomorrow morning when you wake up, do your power
move (three times is great) and then ask yourself some great,
empowering questions:
What are you grateful for in your life?
What are you happy about today?
What are you excited about today?
. Write a few more empowering questions that would put you in
a great state.

they feel good about your product, and make sure they
feel certain they want to buy.
Phase III: Compel – Compel them to want to buy now. Make sure
they actually show up, not just enroll. Sign them up.

DAY FOUR

Step : Prepare and Do Your Homework
Lack of preparation creates call reluctance. Don’t let that happen to
you. Be prepared and do your homework. Know who you’re dealing
with, know all about your product, and be ready to make the sale.

Six Keys to Preparation
. Know who the customer is and anticipate their needs or hurts.
Before you walk in the door, find out as much as you can about
your customer’s needs, his/her values, and how they spend their
time, energy, and money. Ask questions and utilize referrals, the
newspaper, and the Internet.
. Know your own product and its advantages and benefits.
Create such a thorough list that you’ll have strong feelings
about your product and be ready to overwhelm the customer
with your convictions.
. Know your competition. Never knock a competitor.
Know your product’s advantages, and be elegant about how you
present them.
. Know all the potential objections and have answers ready
in advance. It’s fun to call on clients when you know you can
handle any objection they can possibly present.
. Expect the best and prepare for the worst. Put yourself in a
state of positive expectation and plan for schedule changes.
. Create demand. Create conditions where prospects convince
themselves. For example, have the person who gave you the
referral call them and tell them great things about you or
your product.

DAY FOUR



Step : Turn Yourself On
Turning yourself on means putting yourself into a state that can
produce the results you want.
Peak performance comes from being in a peak state.

ANCHOR YOURSELF FOR SUCCESS
…………………
the quickest way to change your state is to
change the way you’re using your body.
1. Choose a word (such as Yes!) and a physical
movement or an anchor (such as clapping your
hands) that will bring you to a peak state.
2. link massive emotional or state change to that
specific word and anchor.
3. Change your physiology radically by using the
clapping and Yes! anchor.

Using a scale from 1 to 10, consciously measure the level or quality
of your state. To be the most effective when you meet a customer,
you need to put yourself in a state that’s so far beyond where you
need to be that when you relax, you’re at level 9.

“the differenCe between beinG an amateur
and beinG a Professional is the ability
to manaGe your state.”

Selling Is a Transference of emotions
Every time you get in front of a customer, the state you’re in and the
feelings you’re experiencing will affect the customer. If you’re not in a
peak state, it’s like cutting off some of your skills and abilities.
Remember,
People associate your state to your product. If you’re in a
negative state, they link those feelings to your product.
You associate your own state to your product. If you feel
lousy and talk about your product, pretty soon all you have to
do is talk about your product and you’ll start to feel lousy.
The same thing happens in any type of relationship—with your
spouse, your children, your family, your friends. Any time you’re in
an intense state, that state gets anchored to anything that’s happening
consistently around you. The state and the anchor get linked,
and that same situation, event, or gesture will trigger that intense
emotional state in the future.

“settinG an examPle is not the main
means of influenCinG others;
it is the only means.”

. How much has it cost you emotionally in the last three years not
to manage your state consistently? How much has it cost you in
terms of frustration, pain, anger, anguish, and regret?

. What will it cost you over the next five years if you don’t change
this pattern?

. What would your life be like in the next five years if you

How much more would you enjoy yourself? How much more
money would you make?

DAY FOUR

Step : Make contact and Get Their Attention
Selling can’t occur unless you make contact. However, it’s not enough
to just make contact. You have to grab the prospects’ attention
immediately and get them interested in hearing your presentation.
The more contact you make, the more sales you make.

Five Keys to Making effective contact
. Set specific goals. Determine the minimum number of calls you
will make every day or every week. Set a specific goal and never
break it.
. Be creative, playful, fun, and outrageous! Don’t prospect or
make contact the same way every time. Make it creative so you
don’t get bored. Make it playful and fun so it becomes something
you look forward to doing.
. Have a plan for what you’re going to say. If you’re
telemarketing, use a script. Know where you’re going so you can
focus on getting the prospects’ attention instead of worrying
about what you should say next.
. Get referrals. Every time you make contact with someone—
whether they buy or not—ask for a referral.
. Do it massively. Make a massive number of contacts at level 10

What Stops People from Making contact?
. They’re not prepared.

Make Contact and Get Their Attention

Today’s session is Phase I, Step 4: Connect and Become Their
Best Friend, and Create Interest.
When two people meet, specific factors kick in to generate rapport,
trust, friendship, and confidence. By identifying and understanding
these factors, you can consistently use them to generate rapport—not
in a manufactured or manipulative way, but in a way that is sincere
and feels good.
Why will a potential client choose you over someone else? Is it your
intelligence? Your product knowledge? Your credentials and test
scores? Probably not. Clients will choose you because they trust you,
like you, have confidence in you, and think you can get the job
done. Most important, they will choose you because they believe you
have their best interests at heart. These next two steps will show you
exactly how to generate those feelings in your clients.

Step : connect and Become Their Best Friend
Contrary to popular belief, the top persuaders in the country
know that the most important aspect of influence is not closing:
It’s creating rapport. Trust is the single most important element in
influencing a sales interview. If you want to influence anyone long
term, you must obtain their trust.
People don’t care how much you know until they know how much
you care. They buy from their friends, even if that friend is a lousy
salesperson—because their friend cares about their needs.

compliments create Power
One of the quickest ways to bond with people is through
compliments. An effective compliment makes people feel important,
appreciated, and noticed but not flattered. To give an effective
compliment:
. State the compliment.
Tell them something you sincerely like about them.
. Justify the compliment.
“I say that because…” provide a reason.
. Immediately ask a question.
“How did you become so effective at that?”
Asking a sincere question makes your compliment more real, it
shows you really care, and you get to learn something.

DAY FIVE



How to Use compliments More effectively
. Give third-party compliments. “Before I called you, I did a little
research. Everyone I talked to said these great things about you…”
. Give compliments about other people. Your compliments will
get back to those people, and amazing things will happen.
. Don’t compliment the obvious. It usually works against you.
. Write a complimentary or thank-you note. After a meeting,
send a note of compliments or thanks.

exercise
Think of three people in your life and write a compliment about
each one. Commit to giving them the compliment within the next
24 hours.

How to Develop Rapport
. Find something in common. When people are like each other,
they tend to like each other. When people are not like each other,
they tend not to like each other. The more they have in common,
the more they’ll like each other. The more differences they think
they have, the less rapport they have.
. Match and mirror. The most powerful tool for bonding is the
process of matching and mirroring—that is, becoming like the
person through the use of your voice and body. Most people try
to develop rapport through words, but words represent only 7%
of your influencing tools.

be, for a while. Then, when you change your pace slightly, they’ll
follow you.

communication Styles
Human beings process information and communicate by using five
senses: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, and gustatory. Of these,
the three we use most often to communicate to the world are visual,
auditory, and kinesthetic. A fourth communication style also exists:
digital, which relies primarily on logic and details.
Most people develop a preference for using one communication style
most frequently. It’s important to know a prospect’s preference.
Visual:

These people talk a little louder and faster, gesture
and move more rapidly, and use words like “picture
this, examine this, or take a look at this.”

Auditory:

These people tend to speak with more resonance in
their voice, be articulate and selective about their
words, and use rhythmic gestures and movements.

Kinesthetic:

These people weigh things and talk slowly and
quietly. When you ask them questions, they might
just move their lips and not notice that they aren’t
saying anything.

Digital:

This type of communicator makes decisions
primarily through logic.

To influence all types of people, you need the ability to communicate
in all four styles—visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and digital—so you
can enter into his/her world.

exercise
Choose someone to match and mirror. Notice the impact. Does the
tone of the interaction change? Does the person respond differently
to you? How quickly can you get rapport and create a relationship?
Can you pace and lead them and get them to start subconsciously
following your lead?

Step : create Interest
Many salespeople jump into their presentation before the prospect
is interested in hearing it. What a waste of time! The final step
in engaging someone is creating genuine interest—getting the
person hungry to hear your presentation. Unless you get a person
really interested, anything you say is going to go in one ear and
out the other.

tHe “BeCAUSe” FRAme
…………………
even if what follows the word because doesn’t make
sense, most people will still comply
as if the reasons were legitimate.

How to create Interest
Make sure that you put them in the kind of state where they really
want to hear more. The key to creating interest is that you do not
begin to give a presentation until you first have someone eager to
hear it.
. Ask a lot of questions.
Questions give the prospect a chance to be in control.
Questions induce the law of reciprocation. When you ask for
and listen to someone’s opinion, they’ll listen to you.
When you ask questions about their interests, you create even
more interest and get them focused on what they want.
. Do a demonstration or exhibit.
. Provide social proof. Talk about something or someone they know.

emotional benefit.
. State another benefit: “What that really means to you is …”
Provide a more personal emotional benefit.
. Provide evidence to support your claim: “And the reason I say
that is …”

presentation that your product didn’t fit their needs, or that they
weren’t the decision maker, or that they weren’t financially qualified
to purchase your product?
Maybe you’ve had a similar situation in your personal life: After
investigating what really happened, you found out that it was
actually your son who tore your kitchen apart, not your daughter. Or
you learned that your boss doesn’t have the authority to give you that
raise. Or you found out that your spouse doesn’t want the new dress
or the swimming pool you were going to talk him/her out of.
Qualifying is an important part of the sales process!

DAY SIX

Step : Qualify Them—Probe for
Problems and Magnify the Hurt
Selling is one of the most enjoyable and rewarding professions—as
long as you feel that as a persuader your job is to find and fill
people’s real needs. If you perceive yourself as a giver in your
relationship with your customers, not a taker, you’ll experience high
self-esteem and a great deal of joy. You’ll be liked by your customers
and you’ll be paid extremely well.
The reason most people experience selling as a pressure business is
because they’re trying to persuade prospects to do something without
knowing who they are, how they make decisions, or what they
really need. The average salesperson’s approach to selling is to find
out a little bit about the prospect’s interests and then do a standard
presentation.
Step 6 will help you enjoy the sales process by teaching you how
to develop a simple systematic program for finding out what your
prospects really want and need and how they make decisions or
justify taking action. With this information, selling becomes easier
and a lot more fun.

Questions for Qualifying customers
Knowing how to get people to associate pain to not having
something they want can be quite motivational. When you’re
qualifying prospects, you need to know their real problems. What’s
an emotional feeling that’s not being fulfilled?
This step is about discovering and magnifying that feeling so they’re
motivated—so they have enough desire.
Desire means having plenty of reasons to like the benefits they’ll get if
they do buy, and plenty of reasons to feel hurt if they don’t buy.

QUALIFYING QUESTIONS

Needs

Sorting Strategies: How People Make Decisions
Knowing people’s metaprograms—their patterns for sorting out
their world—can help you offer the type of information that will
help them make an effective decision. You can easily identify their
patterns by asking the following questions.
. Toward or Away
Question: “What do you want in a job (or product)?”
Toward people are motivated by desire and pleasure; away people
are motivated by fear and pain. To motivate a toward person,
describe a goal or reward. To motivate an away person, describe
something negative.
. Internal or External (Frame of Reference Sort)
Question: “How do you know when you’re really good at something?
How do you know when you’ve done a good job?”
Internal people look to themselves to make decisions; external
people look to others. To motivate internal people, find out
what’s important to them and describe your product with those
criteria in mind. To motivate external people, use testimonials
and statistics to show them what others think.
. Possibility or Necessity
Question: “Why did you choose your present job (or product)?”
Some people are motivated by the possibilities in a situation or
product; others are motivated only when they see the necessity of
buying or changing. To motivate possibility people, show them
what they can do. To motivate necessity people, show them what
they have to do.



DAY SIX

. Matcher or Mismatcher (Relationship Sort)
Question: “What is the relationship between these three coins?”
Matchers look for sameness or how things are alike; mismatchers
focus on how things are different. There are two types of
matchers and two types of mismatchers, and you’ll want to
motivate each one differently.
Matchers
Sameness: These people see everything as the same. To
motivate them, relate your product or service to something
positive in their past experience.
Sameness with Exception: These people see most things as
the same but with something different. To motivate them,
show how your product is like other things they’ve experienced
and also how it’s unique.
Mismatchers
Polarity: Whatever you say, these people do the opposite.
To motivate them, tell them to do the opposite of what you
really want.
Mismatch by Counterexample: Every time you suggest a
possibility; these people give you a counterexample. To sell
them, give them counterexamples before they have the chance.
. Self, Others, or Details (Attention Sort)
This distinction is made by observation, not by asking questions.
Some people are motivated by how a purchase or decision affects
them; some people are equally motivated by how a purchase or
decision affects others; and some people are motivated by details
and data.

DAY SIX



. Completion or Process
Question: “What do you enjoy most in life—getting things done or
being involved in the process?”
Process people enjoy the process; they may want to meet with
you three or four times because they love the process of buying.
Completion people need completion so powerfully that if you
start filling out the application form, they’ll feel compelled to
complete it.
. Convincer Strategy
Question: “How do you know when people are really good at what
they do? Do you have to see it, hear it, do it with them, or read
about it?”
There are two steps to uncovering someone’s convincer strategy:
Find out what kind of evidence it will take to convince them:
visual, auditory, kinesthetic, digital.
Find out how much time it will take: automatic, number of
times, period of time, consistent.
. Generality or Specificity
Question: “Do you want the big picture or do you want
the details?”
The generalist looks at the big picture; the specific person is
concerned with details. Don’t bore the generalist with minor
details, and don’t leave the specific person in doubt by only
presenting the big picture.

“to understand the heart and mind of a Person,
looK not at what he has already aChieVed,
but at what he asPires to.”

— KAHLIL GIBRAN —



DAY SIX

. Past or Future
Question: “What’s most important to you: a product’s past
performance or its future possibilities?”
A person whose focus is on the past needs to know how long
something has been around. A person whose focus is on future
possibilities needs to know what’s possible and what you’re going
to create.
. Cost or Convenience
Question: “Which is more important to you: that this product is
cost-effective or that it makes things easier?”
Generally, most Americans value convenience over cost and for
most Europeans, cost is more important. Pay attention to what’s
most important to people as you’re dealing with them.

C R EATE C O NVI CTI O N & TEST C L O S E
You’ve gone through six steps of the selling process and haven’t
presented your product yet. If you’ve done a good job with the first
six steps and you sit down to meet with a prospect, here’s where
you’ll be:
. You’re prepared. You know whom you’re dealing with, what
they need, and some of their wounds. You know everything
about your product and your competition, and you have a plan
that really makes sense.
. You’re turned on so you can deliver in a powerful way.
. You’ve made contact.
. You’ve made a friend, somebody who feels connected with you,
trusts you, and knows you’re a professional who has their best
interests in mind.
. You have their interest. You made some big fat claims and
backed them up with evidence and benefits.
. You’ve qualified them and you’re in the process of enrolling
them.
Now your job is to move to Step 7: Convince them that they’re
justified in buying, and try a test close.

DAY SEVEN

Journal Notes

DAY SEVEN

Step : create conviction and Test close
The only purpose of a presentation is to create conviction that you
can meet the person’s needs.

Three Ways to create conviction
. Work on your personal congruency. What you say on the
outside must match what you say and feel on the inside.
Condition yourself to have the deepest level of conviction about
your product. Remember, people buy for emotional reasons and
justify with logic. They must have conviction that buying will
give them what they want.
. Work on your ERBNs and LRBNs. Selling means getting
people to make decisions—to weigh their dominant reasons to
avoid buying (DRAB) against their emotional and logical reasons
to buy now (ERBN and LRBN). To make sure the prospects’
fears don’t keep them from buying, assemble plenty of ERBNs
and LRBNs.
. Give prospects enough units of conviction to justify buying.
A unit of conviction has seven parts:
Claim
Fact (“Because…”)
Benefit (“Which means to you…”)
Benefit (“And that really means…”)
Evidence (DEFEATS)
Permission to ask questions (“My purpose at this time is to get
your answers to a few questions.”)
Test close (“In your opinion, do you feel…”)

DAY SEVEN



The Difference Between a Test close and a
close
A test close is an opinion-asking question. It includes words such as,
“In your opinion” and “Do you feel.” Test closing gets the no’s out
early. It’s the single most important skill you have for knowing when
to close. How to close is easy; when to close is the real question.

exercise
. Write out a dozen units of conviction. That’s right—12 of them!
How powerful would you be if you walked into your next
meeting with a huge sack full of units of conviction? How would
it feel to know you could overcome any objection, simply by
reaching into your bag and saying, “Here’s another reason to buy!”
That’s what this exercise will do for you.

DAY SEVEN

Three Types of Test closes
Opening Test Close
Purpose

To start your presentation by finding out where the
buyer is.

Examples

“How long have you been considering owning…?”
“Are you seriously considering owning…?”

Benefits

You find out whether they’re serious and you learn
some of their emotional and logical reasons to buy now
(ERBN and LRBN).

Trade-off Test Close
Purpose

To contrast the reasons for not buying (DRAB) with
a benefit.

Examples

“Would it be worth ________ in order to have ________?”
“To achieve ________, would it be worth an investment
of ________?”

Benefits

If the benefit is strong enough, you have leverage.

Progressive Test Close
Purpose

To get the prospect to focus on buying.

Examples

“If you were to go ahead with this, when would you
want the service to begin?”
“If we were to overcome that challenge, you’d probably
want to go ahead with this investment, wouldn’t you?”

Benefits

You get them to stop focusing on whether they should buy.

A test close lets you see the prospect’s state and know
where they are on the scale. If they’re not moving
toward buying, add more units of conviction.

DAY SEVEN



The ABcs: Always Be (Test) closing
Make sure you’re always test closing, from the first moment you meet a
prospect. Don’t wait until you get to the last steps of the sales process.
You never want to be afraid of finding out where a customer is.
If you’re always test closing, you’ll notice the state the customer is in:
. Know your outcome.
. Take action.
. Pay attention and know what you’re getting.
If what you’re doing isn’t working, change what you’re doing. If that
doesn’t work, keep changing until you find something that does.

Key Buying Signs
Never start to close until the prospect is absolutely ready to buy.
Have the sensory acuity to know whether you’re getting closer or
further away.

S TRATEG I ES
You’ve come a long way! You got yourself prepared and did your
homework, you turned yourself on, and you made contact and got
people’s attention. You connected with them personally, gained
rapport, created interest, and got them engaged.
Then you worked on enrolling them. You found out who they
are and what motivates and drives them, and you discovered their
fears and buying patterns. You worked on helping them justify the
benefits for making the purchase that would far outweigh any fears
or pain that buying might bring.
The final phase is to compel them by making the process real for
them. It’s one thing to tell someone about a rose; it’s another thing
to actually smell one. This last phase is about getting people to see,
hear, feel, smell, and experience the idea that your product or service
will give them what they want most.
The way to do that is through the final three steps:
 :

Convert Objections into Commitments

 : Make It Easy and Create a Future
When you make it real for people, you make it real in their gut.
Logic doesn’t have a whole lot to do with it. You make it real by
showing them that buying means pleasure, and that not buying
means pain. If you can make that real for people, and overcome
any objections they may have, they will buy.

DAY EIGHT

Step : Make It Real and Assume the Sale
How do you go about making someone feel compelled to buy your
product or be influenced by you? You make the experience real, so
they believe it will be “heaven” if they buy and “hell” if they don’t.
Remember, imagination is 10 times more powerful than will.
When people don’t buy your product, it’s because they’ve
linked in their minds that buying would be more painful than
not buying.
When people do buy, it’s because they’ve linked that buying
would be more pleasurable than not buying.
When they experience those emotions—when you help them make it
real—you can assume the sale.

Ask Questions
When you ask questions, prospects will give you a real answer and
they’ll have a real experience inside themselves as well. Questions do
three things:
They change what people focus on and therefore their state.
They change what people delete.
They allow you to access resources.

DAY EIGHT



Use All Five Senses
The best salespeople sell with all five senses. They don’t just tell you
that the product is worthwhile; they give you a sensory experience.
The highest paid people in this country are state inducers. Anything
that will change someone’s state will make things more real for them.

Point—Tell—Paint
If prospects are still not completely convinced, these three strategies
will put them over the edge.
POINT:

“You want a ________ that will ________. Is that correct?”
Ask a question that will put their mind back on their
problem. You can easily open wounds and create a
greater desire to buy just by reminding people about
their problems. Point out the reason they’re buying in
the first place. Make it real by getting them to refocus.
“I know you want a computer system that will be absolutely
efficient and will do this.”
“I know you want a car that will be the best in the world.”
“I know you really want to make an investment in a home
that will bring you a return over the next five years but also
give you a cozy environment for your family.”



DAY EIGHT

TELL:

“Our ________ will do that for you.”
Remind them of the key issue and what your product
will do about it. Reassure them and make the purchase
more real for them. Be specific about what your product
will give them.
“That’s exactly what our computer system will do for you!”

PAINT:

“When you own this product, ________ happens.
[Set the time and place.] Is this what you really want?”
Paint a vivid picture that will help them unleash
their imagination.
“When you own this computer system and the efficiency
in your accounting department jumps 30%, you can walk
in there at one o’clock in the afternoon and people are not
concerned or upset because they haven’t received their check
on time. Payroll is done and people feel happy. Is that what
you want

Then… Assume the sale!

Examples:
“If you were to buy, what are the most important results you

“If you don’t get that, what could it cost you in the next five years?”

. Each night for the next 10 days, come up with three ideas on
how you can get your customers to feel like they already own
your product, even before they buy. What are some unique,
creative, fun things you could do consistently? Be sure to utilize
all five senses—visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, and
gustatory—to associate people with your product’s benefits.

C ONV ERT O B J ECTI O NS I NTO
C OMMITM ENTS
For most salespeople, the fear of objections—of the customer saying,
“No, I don’t want to buy”—is probably the greatest fear of all. For
many, it means failure; personal rejection; and wasted time, energy,
and effort.
What goes through your mind when your prospects offer objections?
Do you feel fearful and hesitant? Or do you say to yourself, “This
is great! They’re asking for more information. Now I can give them the
information they need to buy my product or service!”
Objections aren’t bad or negative. When people offer you
objections, they’re just asking for more information.
The best salespeople in the world make their sales after
handling a minimum of five objections. They see objections as
something to be welcomed, something that has to happen
before the sale can be made.
Before you go any further, take a few minutes to examine your
beliefs about objections. Think about what objections mean to you.
Do you see them as obstacles or opportunities? Something to fear or
something to celebrate?
The purpose of this session is to teach you a system that will make
you so effective at handling objections that you will welcome them.
When you know how to convert objections into commitments,
the next time someone gives you an objection, you’ll be ready to
celebrate!

DAY NINE

Journal Notes

DAY NINE

Step : convert Objections into commitments
An objection is…
An opportunity to know what’s going on in the
prospect’s mind.
An opportunity to understand the prospect’s beliefs and fears.
Your strongest opportunity to close the sale.
A question in disguise.
Objections let you discover the prospect’s dominant reason to avoid
buying (DRAB). When you know the reason, you can answer the
question, take away the fear, and close the sale.
Until you know the objection, you can’t make the sale.
The biggest mistake some people make is to fight an objection. The
key to influencing people is to align with them. Long-term influence
occurs when people know you care, believe you’re like them, and
know you come from an intelligent viewpoint.
Top salespeople handle objections up front. They preframe or brag
about potential objections in advance: “I know the cost of my product
is a challenge. It’s expensive because ________. That’s what sets us apart!”

How to Prevent Objections
Have such a strong level of rapport that people won’t
want to object.
Use test closes.
Use reciprocation. Give to them, and they’ll give back
by not objecting.
Use contrast.
Kill the monster while it’s tiny. Handle the objection
up front, before it gets out of control.

0 Steps to Handling Any Objection
This system really works! Memorize and utilize it, and handling
objections will be quick, easy and fun.
 :

Ignore it. (They may not have meant it.)
Most of the objections people come up with are simply
automatic (“No thanks, I’m just looking”). You can avoid
them by asking better questions that engage the customer
instead of inviting yes or no answers.
The biggest challenges most salespeople have are:
Fear of objections
Belief that you have to fight down objections or
you’ll lose the sale
Desire to answer every possible objection
Tendency to handle objections that are not real
Don’t be so eager to attack an objection. Take a look at it
and let it fly by.

 :

Hear the person out. (They may run out of steam.)
Have you ever noticed that when some people are really
upset, if you just shut up and don’t defend—just really,
sincerely listen to them—they’ll run out of steam and
answer their own objection?

 :

Feed it back (nicely).
Feed the objection back in the form of a question: “It costs
too much?” Many times, in trying to explain their objection,
people will talk themselves out of it.



DAY NINE

 :

Question it. (Get more information.)
Is this the real objection, and why is it important?
Get permission to ask for their reasons, and be polite:
“I know you have reasons for saying that. Do you mind if I
ask what they are?” If they don’t mind, ask, “What are your
reasons?”
Listen strongly! When people tell you the reasons for
their objections, you now have the power to close the sale
because you know what’s really motivating them.

 :

Make it a final objection.
Use the “as if ” frame and test close:
“If we could handle that, would you want to go ahead?”

exercise
Think of the most common objections you get when selling your
product or trying to influence someone. Using the five steps you’ve
just learned, describe how you would handle those objections now.

Your response:

Your response:

DAY NINE



 :

Align with the prospects and provide a cushion.
They’ve now told you their real objection. Put them at ease,
take your time, and make them feel comfortable.
Use “I—he—they—often”:
“I often hear people say that.”
“I’ve often thought that way myself.”
Use agreement frames:
“I appreciate and…”
“I agree and…”
“I respect and…”
When you say “but,” you make the other person wrong.
When you use agreement frames, you make the other
person feel appreciated, respected, and agreed with.

 :

Turn the objection into a question. (You can’t answer an
objection, but you can answer a question.)
Learn this phrase:
“That brings up a question. In spite of [their objection], isn’t
the real question ________?”
For example, “Isn’t the real question…?”
“How can you get much more value here than you
thought you could?”
“How can we make sure you can get the benefits of this
program right now?”



DAY NINE

A good way to ask a question is to open up a hurt again.
Simultaneously remind them of their problem and their
motivation to buy:
“If we don’t do this, won’t it cost you a lot more?”
“Wouldn’t it be important for us to find out how you
can do that so you don’t have to suffer any more?”
“Wouldn’t you benefit more from our plan despite the
initial expense?”
 :

Answer the question.
Why TOM and ED?
Why would you ask me that question after you just
told me you needed the product?
Turn it around. Turn the objection back on them:
“It’s only going to get more expensive later.”
Outweigh it. Use a values question:
“Isn’t it true that ________is more important than your
concerns?”
Minimize the objection. Reduce it to the ridiculous:
“Are you really going to let 20 cents a day keep you from
having what you know is really important to you?”
and
Explain the objection away.
Deny it: “That’s just not true.”

“It costs too much.”

Why?

“ Why are you even considering that

me how desperately you need this.”

turnaround:

“ That’s exactly why you have to do it,
because it will continue to cost too
much until you start earning more
money. That’s why you should invest
in it now, so you can earn more.”

outweigh it:

“ It’s true. It does cost a lot, but how
much will it cost if you don’t do it?
How much will you miss out? What
will be your long-term loss if you
don’t make the investment?”

minimize it:

“It’s definitely an investment, but when
you consider that you presently spend
about $4,000 a year on doughnuts for
your employees, it seems like a small
investment, doesn’t it?”

explain it:

“You’re right. It is a major investment,
and the reason is that seven people
will be working full time on your
account alone. You’re going to be
employing a whole department!”

Deny it:

“ It’s not expensive compared to
everything else out there. I think
you should know… here are five
companies that charge more.”

DAY NINE

 :

Tie it down and test close.
“That solves it, doesn’t it?”
If they say yes, test close.
If they say no, go back to Step 4: “I’m sure you have
reasons for saying that. Do you mind if I ask what they are?”

 : Assume the sale.
The point of assuming the sale is to let buyers know
they’ve bought.
Some of the best ways to assume the sale are:
Congratulate them on a wise decision.
Take out your notebook and begin the
order-blank close.
Make a phone call: “Let me call your order
in so they lock it in at the national office.”

Your Assignment
Choose a situation in which you want to influence your spouse, kids,
or other family member to follow through—for example, taking out
the trash, paying the bills, or cleaning their rooms. Or use another
real situation from your own life.
Ask someone in your family to role-play with you. Find out their
objections and get excited. Then use the 10 steps to turn them around.

Day 10! You made it! You’ve earned your advanced degree in
mastering influence, and you’ve done it through commitment,
persistence, hard work, and, most important, taking action. These
are the keys to the kingdom. If you do nothing else, your enhanced
personal power will increase your sales astronomically. You’re
different now. You’re a cut above the rest.
At this point, you’ve learned most of the tools for mastering
influence. I hope you’ve taken the time to get enough practice so you
feel really confident in the first nine steps. However, there’s still one
more step to add to your arsenal: making it easy for people to buy
and creating a future.
A lot of people get to this point in the sale and just kick back and
rest on their laurels. They don’t realize that this last step is probably
the most important part of the entire process.
This is where you learn how to prevent buyer’s remorse.
This is where you discover the secrets to creating fun, friendly
relationships that will last a long time and empower both you
and your clients.
Most important, this is where you learn how to develop
profitable relationships in the form of referrals and continued
sales in the future.

DAY TEN



Step 0: Make It easy and create a Future
You’ve completed the first nine steps and you’re ready to close the
sale. Here are three keys to making it easy for someone to buy:
Never attack the prospect for raising another objection.
Handle objections in advance.
Give them an unexpected gift.

Six Ways to Make It easy to Buy
. Order-blank close: Break out the order blank and start
filling it in.
. Minor close: Get them to make a minor decision.
“Would you like us to design the envelopes to go with
the logo as well?”
. Alternate choice close: Offer two options. If they decide on
either one, you’ve made the sale.
“Do you want this in blue or green?”
“Should we deliver it on Friday or Saturday?”
. Congratulate them on making a wise decision.
5. Use contrast:
“I’m glad you’re buying this now because the price goes up
in 30 days.”
. Make it fun: If you get them laughing at the time of the close,
you’ve made it easy. Everyone wants a state change.



DAY TEN

Preventing Buyer’s Remorse
Some buyers lose their enthusiasm when they get home. They
re-evaluate their decision, or their spouse or significant other tells
them they made a mistake.
To prevent buyer’s remorse, use future pacing to create a future for
your product in the prospect’s mind. When the sale is concluded
and the paperwork is done, have your prospects imagine themselves
in the future. Have them describe the ways your product will benefit
them for years to come.

FUtURe PACInG
…………………
let’s say you just sold jan a large van.

You:

“Jan, I understand you’re really excited
about this. Is this the right van for you?”

Jan:

“Of course. I wouldn’t have bought it if
it wasn’t. It’s great!”

You:

“Let me ask you a question. A year from
now, what will you be doing with this van
that will make you glad you bought it?”

Jan:

“We’ll be going to the mountains with the
kids and we’ll be . . .”

You:

“Tell me more.”

If you future pace your clients every time, and
you’re absolutely certain that they’ve envisioned
a future for your product, buyer ’s remorse
will be a thing of the past!

DAY TEN



How to Get Referrals
You’ve spent a lot of time and energy developing a relationship. To
create future business, leverage that relationship by asking for referrals.

An eFFeCtIVe ReFeRRAl ReQUeSt
…………………
“The only way I am able to build my business is by
people who are satisfied with me, who feel like I’ve
done a good job. Those people refer me to other
people they care about. Have I done a good job for
you? Would you do me a favor in return? Could I have
the names of five people who…” [Describe in detail.]

Always Search for Referrals
1. Believe that you will get them.
2. Enroll your clients in supporting you; ask them to call two
of the five referrals right then and there.
3. Offer a referral fee or gift.
4. Find out as much information about the referral as possible.
One referral is worth at least 15 cold calls. Every time you make a
sale, ask for some referrals. In fact, even if you don’t get the sale,
ask for some referrals!



DAY TEN

How to Use Referrals
. Use a third-party compliment.
The typical referral goes something like this:
“Hi. This is Tony Robbins. I’m with Robbins Research.
I know Mike Carpenter’s a friend of yours and he told
me to give you a call.”
That’s a perfect example of how NOT to use referrals. Why?
Because the person on the other end of the phone doesn’t care who
you are. To use referrals effectively, you have to get their attention:
“Mr. Williams? Mr. Paul Williams? Mr. Williams, you don’t
know me, but we have a mutual friend and that friend is
Dan Smith. He told me something about you that I thought
was really incredible. [Offer a genuine compliment given
by the previous client.] He feels that you would benefit
tremendously if I were to expose you to an idea that we
have. By the way, my name is Tony Robbins and I’m with
Robbins Research.”
. Create a key person file.
File your clients’ contact information alphabetically in a file box
with 13 sections. Contact the A’s and B’s during week 1; the C’s
and D’s during week 2, and so on. In this way, you’ll cover two
letters of the alphabet each week, and you’ll make contact with
every client at least four times year.

DAY TEN



Your Final Assignment
. Go back through this workbook and read your notes and
homework to seal in what you’ve learned. Take advantage of the
arsenal of material you’ve created.
. Think about a sales call where you tried and failed or just put it
off completely. You know the one—the big daunting one. Take
a moment and think about conquering it. Read over your notes,
get prepared, and commit to making that call within two weeks.

“you and i haVe the ultimate business. if we Care deePly
enouGh, if we really are Professional, if we find PeoPle’s
needs and meet them, we Get to haVe lifelonG friends
and be Paid to haVe them. that’s Pretty inCredible, so
don’t taKe it for Granted. maKe sure that your foCus
