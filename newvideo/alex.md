## Personal Profile

Alex is a successful senior software engineer—but while he's been successful in his career, his personal life has suffered. He's divorced, seeing his kids can be a challenge, and on top of that, he's not really feeling software engineering anymore. That's right: It's midlife crisis time.

It's time for Alex to reconnect and realign with what's important and true. It's time for him to find his True Will. That means orienting his life around helping others—not just his family, but the broader family of the world.

But Alex is too old to be a starry-eyed dreamer. He's also extremely financially conscious, and he knows that in real world terms, the #1 thing he's going to need to achieve his goals is Financial Freedom. And while he may already have some experience and skill with magick, he definitely has room to grow in the financial intelligence department.

Like his younger counterparts, Alex also lacks discipline and purpose, and it's time to get them back. The discipline and focus to serve family/others, and provide for others—where True Will is about connection to others, not the self alone. It's about who he is for the other people in his life (hurt/heal).

Reconnect, Reorient, Reclaim. Reconnect with your True Will. Reclaim yourself.

## Scenario 1
### Most Important Site Interaction

Alex is having a hard time in life. His wife left him, his job feels hollow, everything's fallen to pieces, and he's dwelling in a world of despair. He remembers all the times that he used to feel on fire, and remembers an early time of experimentation with psychedelics and spirituality. Maybe it's time to get that fire back.

Alex has heard about Magick.Me through searching YouTube and then subscribing to the podcast, and he signed up to check out the Core curriculum without thinking too much of it. He likes it a lot, and started becoming a regular follower and seriously applying himself. He then started plugging in to Office Hours for some personalized guidance, and decided to keep coming back for regular attention.

Because of his long faithfulness to the brand, Alex signs up to the Adept and other megacourses as soon as they're announced.

He credits the site with major breakthroughs in his life, and he'll keep coming back for more as long as more content and courses are released. Slowly but surely, he's getting back in touch with who he truly feels he is.
