Welcome to Magick.Me, an online school that focuses on ancient esoteric traditions, philosophies, practices and rituals that are brought into the modern world. We are excited to share our newest and most innovative courses yet: The Adept Initiative and the Adept initiative II. 


These courses have been designed sequentially to advance the student along their path through life in a way that is powerful, insightful, authentic and transformative. You are going to be amazed with your results, and surprised just how potent these latent practices are. 


Let’s check out what our teacher, Jason, has prepared for you:


In the Adept Initiative you will learn to awaken your inner adept. What does it mean to be an adept? 


An adept is a person who is highly skilled at certain practices. The Adept Initiative initiates the student into their own inner brilliance by blending ancient wisdom with modern methodologies. Consider this the art of being a full actualized human being who just appears magical to those on the outside looking in. 


The modules in this course will allow the Adept the foundational ma–terials needed to begin their magical initiation. We will begin by exploring the True Will, the importance of Meditation, understanding Yoga and Yogic philosophies, learning about the subtle energies which direct our lives, financial security and many more foundational techniques that will ground you on your journey. The overall goal of the Adept Initiative is to secure stability so you can begin journeying safely to higher realms of existence.  


The Adept Initiative II will allow the Adept to launch into space, which is why it is very important to learn the techniques of grounding before taking this course. 


In this course, Jason will take you on a journey through the ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life. At this point the adept will learn about the fundamentals of Ceremonial Ritual Magick, Symbolism, Astral pathworking, Elemental and Planetary Magick, as well as understanding correspondence tables and working with deities. 


Think of the Adept Initiative as planting your roots deeply into the Earth, and the Adept Initiative II as stretching out into the Heavens. 


These courses will be taught LIVE beginning in January and will last 12 weeks, with a month break in between. 


You may have noticed that there are several options to choose from:


Our Standard version of both Adept I & II allows the user full access to the course modules and the community forum. 


Our Premium users will have access to the Standard features as well as access to advanced modules, live group coaching, and a bonus workshop.


Our VIPs will have access to all of the Premium features with the exciting bonus of having 1-1 private coaching with our teacher, Jason. 


Because the world is in dire need of adepts shining their light, Jason has offered a bundle option that will allow the user to obtain maximum savings. Please check out our payment options below to customize your experience.

[Camera opens on Jason Louv, speaking directly to camera with warm, confident energy]
"Hey, I'm Jason Louv. And I need to be direct with you for a moment.
Right now, you're at a crossroads. You can feel it. The world is changing faster than ever before, and the old ways of thinking, the old paradigms... they're crumbling.
You know you need to level up. To gain real power. Real influence. Real magick.
That's why I created The Adept Initiative 2.0. This isn't just another online course - this is the most comprehensive, step-by-step system for mastering practical magick ever created.
[Lean in slightly, more intimate]
Let me be clear: What I'm teaching here isn't theoretical. These are the exact same techniques I've used to:
Build multiple six-figure businesses
Advise Fortune 500 companies and tech leaders
And help thousands of students create real, measurable change in their lives
But here's what makes this different: I've completely rebuilt the program from the ground up. New techniques. New technologies. New ways to accelerate your results that weren't even possible before.
[Shift tone to create urgency]
Now, I know you might be thinking 'I'll get to this later' or 'Maybe this isn't the right time.'
But ask yourself: How much longer can you afford to wait? While others are mastering these skills and getting ahead, are you willing to stay stuck where you are?
[Warm smile, shift to solution]
That's why I've made this as accessible as possible. You'll get:
Lifetime access to all materials
Live group coaching calls with me personally
A private community of serious practitioners
And my personal guarantee: If you do the work, you will see results.
[Final compelling close]
The doors are open now, but they won't stay open forever. This is your moment to step up and claim the power that's rightfully yours.
Join us. Let's make magick real.

"Hey, I'm Jason Louv. And I want to talk about something that's been weighing on your mind.
You've felt it - that deep knowing that there's more. That the ancient wisdom traditions hold real power, real transformation. But until now, accessing that power has been fragmented, confusing, or wrapped in outdated thinking.
That's why I'm thrilled to announce that The Adept Initiative is back, and it's evolved into something extraordinary. We've created not just one, but two sequential, comprehensive programs that will systematically transform you into a true magical adept.
[Lean in, more intimate]
Let me break this down for you:
The Adept Initiative starts by planting your roots deep into the earth. You'll master:
Discovering your True Will
Advanced meditation techniques
Yogic philosophies and practices
Mastery of subtle energies
Financial sovereignty
These aren't theoretical concepts - these are the exact foundational practices that create real, measurable stability in your life.
Then, in The Adept Initiative II, we launch into the heavens. You'll journey through:
The ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life
Ceremonial Ritual Magick
Advanced astral pathworking
Elemental and Planetary Magick
Working with deities and correspondence tables
[Create urgency and value]
Now, I know what you might be thinking - 'Can I really do this?' Let me be clear: These courses begin live this January, running for 12 weeks each, with a month's break between them. And I've created three ways to join:
Standard: Full access to all course modules and our vibrant community forum.
Premium: Everything in Standard plus advanced modules, live group coaching, and an exclusive bonus workshop.
VIP: All Premium features plus private 1-on-1 coaching sessions with me personally.
[Shift to compelling close]
Here's the most exciting part - I'm offering a special bundle option that combines both programs at maximum savings. Because let's be honest - the world needs more adepts shining their light right now.
As Socrates said, 'The unexamined life is not worth living.' But I'll go further - the unempowered life is not worth living. This is your moment to make your life a work of art, of magick, an expression of your highest potential.
The doors are open now for January enrollment, but space is limited, especially for Premium and VIP tiers. Click below to secure your spot and begin the journey to becoming a true adept.
This is your calling. Answer it."




"Hey, I'm Jason Louv. And I want to talk about something that's been keeping you up at night.
You're successful. You're intelligent. You've done everything 'right.' But there's still this gnawing feeling that you're not living your full potential. That somehow, you're still playing small.
You know there's something more - a deeper truth, a higher purpose, your True Will. But in a world of surface-level spirituality and quick-fix solutions, finding that truth feels impossible.
[Lean in, more intimate]
I get it. I've spent decades mastering the authentic, time-tested systems that actually work. And now, I've distilled them into something revolutionary: The new Adept Initiative.
This isn't just another course. This is a complete system for discovering and unleashing your True Self - who you were meant to be before the world told you who to be.
[Build intensity]
The Adept Initiative starts by breaking through what's holding you back:
The feeling of being trapped in a life that's too small
The frustration of knowing you're meant for more
The exhaustion of wearing masks that aren't really you
The fear that you'll never find your true path
Then, through two powerful sequential programs, you'll:
Discover and align with your True Will
Master ancient practices made relevant for modern life
Build unshakeable spiritual and financial foundations
Access real magical power - not watered-down New Age fluff
Join a community of serious practitioners who get it
[Create urgency with specifics]
Starting this January, over 12 weeks, you'll receive:
In The Adept Initiative:
Core practices for awakening your inner adept
Advanced meditation and yogic techniques
Mastery of subtle energies
Financial sovereignty methods
Foundation for safe magical practice
Then in Adept Initiative II:
Journey through the Tree of Life
Real Ceremonial Magick
Advanced astral pathworking
Elemental and Planetary Magick
Direct work with deities
[Address objections]
Now, I know you might be thinking this sounds intense. Good. It is. This isn't for dabblers or tourists. This is for people who are ready to do the real work.
But you won't be alone. Choose from three levels of support:
Standard: Full course access plus community forum
Premium: Added advanced modules, live group coaching, bonus workshop
VIP: Everything plus private coaching with me
[Final compelling close]
Here's the truth: The world doesn't need more people playing small. It needs individuals who have found and unleashed their True Will. Who have aligned with their highest purpose.
That's why I'm offering a special bundle option combining both programs. Because once you start this journey, you won't want to stop halfway.
The doors are open now for January enrollment. But especially for Premium and VIP tiers, space is strictly limited.
This isn't just another course. This is your path to becoming who you were always meant to be.

"Hey, I'm Jason Louv. Let's talk about being stuck.

You know that feeling. You're successful on paper. You've checked all the boxes. But something isn't moving. Something isn't flowing. You're trapped in a life that's too small for who you really are.

[Lean in, create connection]

Maybe it shows up as:

That 3 AM anxiety when you know you're meant for more

The frustration of watching another year pass without real change

The exhaustion of maintaining a life that looks good but doesn't feel right

That constant, nagging feeling that you're not living your True Will

[Bridge to solution]

Here's what nobody tells you: Being stuck isn't a failure - it's a signal. It's your True Self demanding to be unleashed.

That's why I've completely rebuilt The Adept Initiative. This isn't about adding more spiritual band-aids or temporary fixes. This is about breaking free and becoming who you were meant to be.

[Build momentum with specifics]

Starting this January, through two powerful sequential programs, you'll:

First, in The Adept Initiative:

Break through what's keeping you stuck

Master meditation and yogic practices that create real change

Learn to work with subtle energies that move mountains

Build unshakeable spiritual and financial foundations

Create the stability to launch into higher realms

Then, in Adept Initiative II:

Journey through the ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life

Master Ceremonial Ritual Magick that actually works

Access advanced astral pathworking

Command Elemental and Planetary forces

Work directly with deities and correspondence tables

[Address resistance]
Now, you might be thinking: 'I've tried other programs before.' Good. That means you know the difference between real transformation and spiritual entertainment.

This isn't another workshop that leaves you exactly where you started. This is a comprehensive 12-week system for breaking free and stepping into your power. STEP BY STEP

[Create clear choice]

I've created three ways to ensure you get unstuck:

Standard: Full access to all course modules and our serious practitioner community
Premium: Added advanced modules, live group coaching, and an exclusive workshop
VIP: Everything plus private 1-on-1 coaching sessions with me

[Compelling close]

Here's the truth: Being stuck is optional. Right now, you have a choice. You can keep feeling that frustration, that stagnation, that knowing you're meant for more...

Or you can take action. Break free. Discover and unleash your True Will.
I'm offering a special bundle option for both programs because this journey of liberation needs both roots and wings.

Enrollment is open now for January, but space is limited, especially in Premium and VIP tiers.
The only question is: Are you ready to get unstuck?
