Discover Your True Purpose
The Adept Initiative is an in-depth training program in magick and mysticism, designed to give you absolute mastery over your life.
This first-of-its-kind Megacourse will leverage the greatest spiritual tools available to humanity to liberate, empower and awaken you to your innate freedom and true purpose in life—and it will provision you with the tools you need to fulfill that purpose. And not twenty years in the future, but Now.
The purpose of this course is to free you both spiritually and financially. It is to create free, awakened, self-reliant men and women—even, perhaps especially, in a time of universal deceit.
There will be no New Age silliness. No wishful thinking. No dogma. Just raw, effective technique, backed by science and practical experience.
This massive course—comparable to a binge-worthy Netflix show or a major video game—is constructed so that it can be integrated with even the busiest work schedule, and even increase your focus on your daily duties, rather than taking you away from them.
This will not be a course about theory and academic knowledge. It will be an immersive, life-changing experience. Whether you're brand new to this topic or have a lifetime of experience, The Adept Initiative will supercharge your soul and transform your life forever.
 
An alchemical process of total transformation.

"The value that Jason Louv has provided in this course is beyond anything I have seen in the magical community, and in academia thus far. I have been in the training and education profession for over a decade. The compendium of knowledge and supplementary material that Jason has assembled is only rivaled by the highest echelon of academic providers. The integration of technology; i.e. biofeedback tools, Web-based analytics, and ubiquitous/blended learning techniques to extend the classroom beyond the traditional setting are all hallmarks of an instructor that understands how to truly integrate the course material into a highly impactful class that benefits from the best technological tools available. Beyond that, the amount of contact hours, time on required tasks, and availability for student question and answer sessions should not be taken for granted. In summary, this course is a steal for the price. Love and good Magick all."
- Drew P.

"My experience with Jason Louv as instructor has been amazing and edifying. Not only was the material truly fascinating—but also earthy and applicable to negotiating all manner of life concerns. Information is power—this is the place to be!"
- Bonnie L.

"Truly the most return for the money I have ever gotten. No woo-woo at all, just hours of disciplined activity, focused effort and hard questions to ask and answer yourself. I recommend the school to you if you are ready to give everything and want to discover what it is you want and how to get it. Jason packs the classes with valuable information, and you can wring the juice out of them and into your own life. He really knows magick without being ungrounded or cryptic, and he makes himself available to his students completely and answers questions thoroughly. This class is especially useful to artists, musicians and anyone who has to blaze their own trail. Or anyone that wants to get to the core of their reality."
- Wes P.
 
Upgrade Your Selfware.
Like you, I live in the real world—not some far-off, wishful-thinking paradise. And I recognize that the first step of spiritual liberation is material and financial liberation. You can't effectively meditate, let alone help anybody, if you're worried about keeping the lights on.
That's why step one of this course is getting you financially free and out of the daily grind of wage slavery. This is no overnight process—but with a few correctly applied principles and financial education, anybody can make the shift from working for money to having money work for them.
The true goal of spirituality is to reclaim your innate, divine self. In order to do that in the 21st century, we need to do two things: Give you the meditative tools to recover your true self, and also free you from fear and financial worry. This course will do both.
In my way of thinking, there is no difference between the material and the spiritual world—anybody who claims that financial concerns are "beneath" spiritual people has probably never had to worry about money, and certainly hasn't faced the issues that real people are facing in the real world, right now. Liberating yourself materially and liberating yourself spiritually are one process—the mastery of Malkuth, the physical world.
Many armchair commenters on mysticism like to advance the view that the physical world should be beneath the concern of the aspirant, or that spiritual wisdom somehow allows you to transcend it. This is a destructive and false view.
Unless they take the easy way out and become a complete renunciate, mastering the real world is the primary concern of the spiritual aspirant, and never ceases to be a concern. Without a grasp of the material world, one has no stable base from which to perform one’s duties to society, or peace and silence within which to meditate. The meditation chamber is not an escape from the world; it is the hard-earned reward of the samurai warrior who confronts life head-on and wins, or at least succeeds in taking enough territory within which to cultivate higher spiritual qualities.
This course places the student at the center of their life, and allows them to redesign their life plan in accordance with their higher will—to build the stable and secure base of the pyramid that is their life. To do this, we employ both spiritual and material techniques, and merge them both in pursuit of our goal—as above, so below. In fact, we must do so, as employing techniques of material gain without spiritual insight only leads to buying a life you realize you didn’t actually want, and seeking spiritual insight without a firm material basis leads to homelessness. What we want is to know exactly the life we want—not according to our passing wishes and wants, but according to the bedrock spiritual blueprint of our True Will, that which is our role to truly fulfill in this life.
 
The Cross of the Elements

This course takes the Western esoteric training systems of the past and updates them for the hyperconnected, disintegrative 21st century. Whereas prior generations of Western seekers gathered in covert Masonic lodges and secret societies to pursue the mysteries, we now have the Internet, for better and worse. Rather than lament this change, I have chosen to make full use of its capabilities to provide the best possible quality esoteric instruction to the greatest possible number of students—students who can meet and practice together virtually from all over the entire planet, a truly unprecedented situation never before possible at any other time in world history.

Throughout this course, you will be firmly situated in, and master, the cross of the elements—the elemental forces that symbolically make up your life, and which must be balanced to make your life a masterpiece. For those with an awareness of the more technical side of Western esotericism, this means that this course instructs along similar lines to the elemental grades of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, as well as Franz Bardon's Initiation Into Hermetics, while recontextualizing this material for the hypermodern world.

They are:


Earth. At the outset of the work, the student will begin to build their elemental circle (with inner Tao), select its location, prepare ritual garments, acquire elemental tools and record, and select a magical name and motto for the duration of the course. Next, the aspirant will begin to master their physical health and vitality, definitively build their map of the universe and their place in it, and solidly root and anchor themselves within life. They will master their finances, designing the next steps for their career and implementing long-term strategies for both active and passive wealth creation. They will also begin to employ the strategies of practical magic to achieve their goals, including visualization, trance induction, astral work and lucid dreaming.


Air. Here the aspirant will make a series of hard decisions about what to include in their life—and what must go. They will undertake a review of their existence and begin the process of cleaning up those areas which need it, removing negative influences, self-destructive behaviors and anything that functions to generate unnecessary drama. The aspirant will also be given tools to internalize this process and begin to critically review their own thinking, and remove destructive thought patterns and self-deception—as well as being given the critical thinking and logical tools necessary to ruthlessly destroy New Age wishful thinking, baseless religious dogma, pseudoscience and other traps passed off as “spirituality” in the marketplace. Finally, they will begin the core, authentic processes of Raja Yoga—Asana and Pranayama—allowing them to first establish and then perfect their control of their physical body and emotions. The yoga taught here will not be drawn from the gymnastics exercises generally called yoga in the mainstream, but from core, initiatory Vedic and Tibetan sources.


Water. While the aspirant will have been working on their rational and logic mind in Air, here they will deepen their ability to immerse themselves in their intuitive faculties. To do so, they will gain a mastery of trance and visionary state induction, and work with ancient divinatory systems like the Tarot and I Ching to build a bridge to their non-linguistic, intuitive mind. Here they will also begin getting into the “hard coding” of their life, reviewing the heady world of past lives, karma and astrological templating.


Fire. With new understanding of self gained, the aspirant will now clearly and definitively state their ultimate Will for their life, and massively strengthen their daily reserve of willpower and decisiveness. And unlike other systems, which completely overlook this step, they will also learn how to both check that this Will is congruent with their deep psychology and their environment, but they will also learn to bind the opposite, as no force can be invoked without also invoking its equal and opposing force. We will also do immense work on resolving internal conflicts—the competing desires that produce self-sabotage—so that the road forward opens and remains open. Now, at last, we will put the full heft of magical, mystical and gnostic techniques into manifesting your Will into reality. Finally, and most importantly, we assess the role of relationship, and conscious relationships as the most important spiritual practice of all.


Spirit. With the four elements now working properly as a balanced wheel carrying you forward into the future, we will now work on techniques for linking your temporal personality with your transcendent, spiritual self, your Self Beyond Self, that which lies beyond the small-s self. To do so, we will combine all previous techniques and accelerate them with the higher rungs of yoga—Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi—allowing you to make your life singularly focused and spiritualized.

"I laughed, I cried, and at some point during the course I suddenly realized that my life can and will never be the same, as a direct result of Jason Louv's highly opinionated and not-f***ing-around introduction to magic. Do your self (and the world) a favor—sign up already!"
- George T.

"This is where you want to go if you want to get rid of all of the fluff. If you are new to magick or are feeling overwhelmed by everything out there, Jason will help by cutting out everything you don't need and get you straight to the core. To paraphrase Jason a bit, you will find no rings, no grades, no tattoos and nothing spooky here. This class has given me all new perspectives on concepts I've already been initiated into and taught me plenty of new material to weave in and solidify it all. With daily check-ins and homework from Jason, I was able to stay motivated and on track with the incremental increases of work. And due to the length of the course, the habits have been established to stay. All that's left is for me to keep on doing the work. If you want results, this is where to go. If you want to interact with a community of people who are actively practicing, this is where to go. If you want to discover your True Will, this is where to go. If you want to do the great work, this is where to go. Everything here is relevant and up to date for our current moment in history. This is THE modern Magick school!"
- Alec S.

"I can't begin to list all the ways this course has changed my life in just six weeks. Jason is a Goddess send to me, and his way of teaching is perfect for how I learn. I would recommend this course, as well as the rest of his courses to anyone seeking to understand the world of magick! Thank you again Jason Louv for creating Magick.Me—it's just what we need in this time."
- Michelle H.
 
Lights On.
Here's just a few of the things you'll learn in the course:
• How to wake up, liberate yourself both spiritually and financially, and become a change agent
• You'll get the best tools in the world for self-empowerment, mastering your life, and achieving spiritual fulfillment—in any environment, no matter what the condition of the world is. I'm going to gear you up with the best spiritual tools on the planet and blast you off into the future
• How to enhance your intelligence and daily joy with the most potent brain change techniques of Eastern yoga and Western mysticism
• How to not only survive our chaotic and fragmented world, but thrive in it. (A task that will only get harder with the coming of automation, massive job loss and economic recession. Are you prepared?)
• How to become a competent and empowered leader, and chart a course for yourself and others in a rudderless world with no working maps or models
• How to free yourself by reducing your karmic footprint—stopping what goes around so that it doesn't come around.
And lots, lots more.
 
I bring you fire.

Who am I? I'm a guy who has spent nearly a quarter century learning every spiritual tool on earth to heal and improve his own life. You name it, I've done it—the good, the bad, and the downright bizarre. And throughout all of it, I kept asking a few core questions: What actually works? What can actually help people? And what can I safely jettison as being just superstition? This course is the result.
I'm not some kind of guru. I'm an all-too-human guy that's had his share of mistakes and mayhem. But I DO know my sh*t. And my message isn't to be some kind of all-knowing all-perfect spiritual being whose farts smell like lavender and peppermint—it's to work on your self one day at a time and EVOLVE. We all have baggage and shortcomings—it's part of being human. True spirituality means struggling to better yourself, to strive towards bettering your life, knowing you will never be perfect—but that you can absolutely be great.
To achieve just that, in this course I leverage, update and ship the greatest spiritual tools in the world to empower you, liberate you, and awaken your higher potential—because what the world needs most is YOU, at your absolute most empowered. My goal with this course is to advance and evolve the world's spiritual technology as fast as, or beyond, the rate our material technology is advancing at—because, frankly, we're in trouble if we don't! And so in this course, I'm going to absolutely maximize your potential as a human being—all the way.
Over the last two decades of my career as an author (John Dee & the Empire of Angels, Generation Hex and many others—more about my books, podcasts and other projects here) and public spiritual teacher, I've worked with thousands of people from all walks of life. I've worked with average people like myself, running home businesses, struggling to make it as artists, or working every day at the hardest job of all, raising a family. I’ve worked with people who are homeless, struggling to escape heroin addiction; and I’ve worked with people from the very heights of society—financial traders, advertising and big tech executives, and major celebrities (privacy dictates that I don't share their names, but you would know them instantly).
In all of that, I’ve come to understand that we truly have far more in common as human beings than we have differences—and even more so, that at the spiritual level, we all share the same anxieties, the same deep needs, the same profound yearning for transcendence, meaning and connection with that which is larger than us. And that because we are so similar at the spiritual level, that spirituality is a universal language, and that the techniques of true spirituality, separated from the dogmatic stories they come wrapped in, and which so often keep us separate from each other, are what are most truly needed in our world.
That’s why I’ve spent my life bringing those techniques to people, minus the dogma and superstition. This course is therefore my life's work. And I'm proud to bring it to you.


"The Adept Initiative course blew my mind. Jason went above and beyond in this course, and I can't recommend going on this journey enough! At the start of this course, I was stuck in an apartment I didn't want to be in and work that wasn't fulfilling. At the end of six weeks I was able to move out and find a new beautiful apartment, and expanded my business to something that now fills my heart. Thank you for all your hard work and effort. It is treasured."
- Brian G.

"Magick.Me provides the essential tools and skills for living that are sorely missing in our education and school system. It is the foundation I sorely needed as I approached a critical turning point in my own life. Jason is a masterful teacher, whose intellect, knowledge and passion are consistently inspiring. He sets an example for what it means to be a magician—one who expertly leads a productive, purposeful and generous life."
- Robert M.

"The pre-course publicity for The Adept Initiative said something like 'this course will change your life.' I read it and laughed and thought, yeah, great marketing. Can you guess what happened next? I started the course, and by day two it had already changed my life. So don't hesitate to sign up for Jason's courses. He keeps his promises."
- Merl F.
 
Among the Greats
Because of our culture's persistent biases, we are often told that interest in spirituality is "not serious," and it is often portrayed as a silly or fringe pursuit. Nothing could be further from the truth. Even a cursory glance through history, and the headlines, will reveal that some of the most successful men and women in our world, from all walks of life, backgrounds and professions, have had a vast and deep interest in practical spirituality, esoteric philosophy, and even, in many cases, magick. Listed below are just a few of the most famous and successful—the list could go on forever. Please note that mentioning these individuals does not mean they directly endorse my course, or that they have ever heard of me—simply that their interest in, and often sincere practice of, the same classical methods taught in this course is a matter of public record.

"The Adept Initiative course is the best method online that I have seen for aspiring students of magick to learn the tools needed to peer behind the curtains of reality. At its core, the course blends the best techniques of Buddhism, Yoga and Western Esotericism to put students on the fast track to discovering their True Will and the power to exercise it. It is the real work. Dabblers and the merely curious should not apply."
- Drew S.

"My experience with magick.me has been life changing. I cannot say enough good things about Jason and his teachings. His classes have cleared up a great many things that I’ve had misconceptions about for years. The Adept Initiative was an amazing class and I couldn’t wait to see the next lesson each day. Jason basically created a modern day Golden Dawn that’s more accessible, and dare I say effective for the seekers of this century. Magick.me is a wonderful place if you are seeking this kind of light."

 Frequently Asked Questions

When does the course start and finish?
This course is fully recorded, and starts as soon as you sign up for it. Whether you go slow or binge-watch it, you can go at whatever speed you like. The course consists of about 23 hours of recorded lecture material, and with homework included, will take you between 40-70 hours to complete, the same as a Netflix binge or major video game. Most students complete the coursework over a six week period.
How long do I have access to the course?
How does lifetime access sound? After enrolling, you have unlimited access to this course for as long as you like—across any and all devices you own.
Is there a refund policy on the course?
Here's my pledge to you: If you watch up to three units of the course, and still truly feel that by sincerely applying the techniques in this course, you won't make back at *least* 10x the amount you invested in the course, I will refund 100% of your money. I'm happy to make this pledge, because the feedback I get instead is people repeatedly telling me that I am charging far too little for the course!
Do existing Magick.Me subscribers get access to this course?
No. Existing Magick.Me subscribers will need to register for this course separately. The Adept Initiative is a completely separate Mega-Course with massive new production and stringent student guidelines, and is separate from the main Magick.Me courses. The regular Magick.Me courses and office hours will continue as planned at their own pricing tier.
Do I need prior experience?
No. This course will be massively groundbreaking for everyone from absolute beginners to students with decades of experience. You do not need to have taken any of the other Magick.Me courses before enrolling.
I have extremely limited time in my schedule. Can I still take this course?
Yes! This course is designed so that it can be taken on even the busiest schedule and integrated into your work day during moments of downtime. With a few moments here and there to watch units (or listen to them in your headphones like a podcast while doing errands or during transportation), you'll be just fine. You should also provision about 30 minutes a day for meditations and exercises, either first thing in the morning or at another convenient time. If you have more time, you can of course extend the exercises much longer, but 30 minutes a day is solid.
Do I need to buy any extra equipment to take this course?
No. You should be able to do the exercises in this course empty-handed, or by repurposing common items. You certainly CAN purchase fancier gear—but you don't NEED to.
